There is not much I can say about Vonnegut that hasn't been repeated too often before. There is, however, very much to love abou this work and I hope my appreciation for it shines through in this reimagined cover for Breakfast of Champions (1973).

A Vonnegut book cover must be colorful. A writer who can turn the most existential of crises and horrific happenstance into emphatic pageturners and include hilarity on every one of those pages, combined with mind-opening humanist philosophy, deserves the whole spectrum, really.

title: Time Travel
description: >-
  Have you seen the Back to the Future trilogy? Great Scott! That sure blew my
  young impressionable mind out of its cognitive dungeons. A bit further down
  the road, I still enjoy stretching my neural muscles with scientific and
  philosophic publications, and James Gleick's Time Travel, A History (2016),
  has both these characteristics.


  I modeled my approach for this jacket after the cover of Gleick's other superbly written “The Information”, where the main ingredient is type, and lots of it - in your face.


  Time Travel, and this cover, are dynamic, and larger than life. The font hints at the American Airlines logo, meaning you’d better strap in, and enjoy the ride ahead. Gleick’s ideas, and therefore also the titles, are bursting out of the margins. Finally, there's no escaping the blue and red type fighting for every bit of your attention.
